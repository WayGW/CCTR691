Findable:
1. It meets the criteria as it has a global unique ID and is deposited in a global data repository (GSE276609 and GEO, respectively)
2. It meets this criteria as it has descriptive metadata describing the data origin (organism, experiment type, study design, contributors, platforms, samples with descriptions, etc.)
3. It meets this criteria as the data is readable by both people and machines

Accessible:
4. I think it meets criteria as access to the dataset is restricted until Sep 5, 2025; however, I can not find any specific license information in any of the attached files or in the GEO information sections.
5. It meets this criteria as it is in a public data repository and it using previously subimtted data also submitted to a repository.

Interoperable:
6. I think it does this, but I am not well versed in this. It uses what I assume are standard controlled vocabulary (like xenograft, triple-negative breast cancer, estrogen receptor positive breast cancer, etc.) but I am not in this specific field so I am unsure.

Reusable:
7. It meets this criteria. It contains information about the data generation and is also using previously generated data and re-analyzing it with links to the previous results.
8. It meets this criteria (also still confused how this is different than 6?) as it is using coomunity-endorsed standards for disease classifcation and experimental technique nomenclature.
9. I am not sure it  meets this criteria. If cloupe files are proprietary then it does not (unless the RAW folder provided also contains non-proprietary files that can generate the same output as the cloupe (eventually) then it does meet the criteria). 
However, it also links to the raw sequencing files via SRA so I think it does meet this criteria.
10. I believe it meets this criteria, I didn't see anything about a data management plan but it appears to have a plan for the future in place as it is private until Sep 5, 2025.
